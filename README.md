# Image_Caption_Generator_CNN_LSTM
A deep learning approach to Image caption generator - problem at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. 
In the realm of computer vision and natural language processing, the fusion of Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) has revolutionized
the task of image captioning. This mini-project explores the synergy between these two powerful
architectures to generate descriptive captions for images automatically.
The primary objective of this mini-project is to develop an end-to-end model capable of
generating coherent and contextually relevant captions for input images. By leveraging the
feature extraction capabilities of CNNs and the sequential modeling prowess of LSTMs, the
system aims to bridge the semantic gap between visual content and natural language
descriptions.
